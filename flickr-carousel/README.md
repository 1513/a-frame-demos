# A-Frame Flickr Carousel

A virtual reality web app demonstration, using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

It pulls a set of photos from Flickr dynamically and displays them in a circular carousel.

Click to advance to the next photo, or just look around with a WebVR-compatible headset on.

## Local development

Please note that the `index.html` file in this folder is intended to be transformed by Jekyll,
to fit in well with the rest of this collection of demos.

If you would prefer to view the version with raw HTML, without requiring Jekyll, it is available at:
[github.com/poshaughnessy/aframe-flickr-carousel](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/aframe-flickr-carousel).
