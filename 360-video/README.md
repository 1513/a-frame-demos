# 360 Video Demo

This demonstrates a 360 video playing in the background, with 3D models placed in the scene. You should see some 3D 
blocks on the pavement and a rubber duck bobbing up and down on the river!

Thanks to [Diego](https://github.com/diekus) for the video, recorded in Paris with a Samsung Gear 360.

## NB. Does not currently work on Android

I'm working on this. The following should be helpful:

* [A-Frame issue: "Videos and videospheres don't work on mobile"](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/316)
* [Example 'mobile' videosphere](https://gtk2k.github.io/aframe_videosphere/) and [source code](https://github.com/gtk2k/gtk2k.github.io/blob/master/aframe_videosphere/index.html). 
NB. This works for me when launched standalone from homescreen icon.
