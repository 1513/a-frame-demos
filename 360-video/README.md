# 360 Video Demo

This demonstrates a 360 video playing in the background, with 3D models placed in the scene. You should see some 3D 
blocks on the pavement and a rubber duck bobbing up and down on the river!

Thanks to [Diego Gonzalez](https://github.com/diekus) for the video, recorded in Paris with a Samsung Gear 360.

Please note the restriction that on Android, video [requires a user interaction before it can play](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/316).
This is why there is a prompt at the beginning.
